# Programming Fundamentals – Python Projects  

This repository contains my Python projects for my **Programming Fundamentals** college course. Each file demonstrates core programming concepts such as variables, arrays, loops, conditionals, functions, and classes.

## 🚀 Featured Project: Predictive Health Tracker (final.py)
### This is the most advanced project in the repository, moving beyond procedural scripts to a fully Object-Oriented solution for health forecasting.

### Key OOP Implementation Details:
- Class Encapsulation: I designed a custom User class to bundle data (cycle length, history) and behaviors (prediction logic) into a single, manageable object.
- Method Logic: The class includes specialized methods like predictperiod() and predictovul() that perform  calculations using Python's datetime and timedelta libraries.
- State Management: By using an __init__ constructor, the program initializes unique user instances, allowing for persistent storage of period and ovulation history within internal arrays.
- Predictive Modeling: The script utilizes class-based logic to transform raw historical data into future-dated forecasts, demonstrating a transition from basic coding to functional software engineering.

## 📂 Project Files  

### 1. `array.py`  
- Demonstrates the use of **arrays (lists of lists)** and user input.  
- Allows the user to input their name and age, which are added to the existing array until the user types `done`.  

### 2. `conditionals.py`  
- Demonstrates **conditional statements (if/elif/else)** and **control flow**.  
- Includes:  
  - Simple true/false conditional checks  
  - Multi-way branching  
  - A simple game loop where the user can enter numbers and see whether their sum is positive, negative, or zero.  

### 3. `final.py`  
- A more advanced project using **classes, functions, and datetime**.  
- Features:  
  - A `User` class that predicts the next **period date** and **ovulation date** based on cycle length and first period date.  
  - Stores period and ovulation history in arrays.  
  - Allows continuous input and predictions through a loop.  

### 4. `functionsandclasses.py`  
- Demonstrates **object-oriented programming** with classes.  
- Includes:  
  - `Circle` class (with area calculation)  
  - `Rectangle` class (with area calculation)  
- User can choose which shape to calculate area for.  

### 5. `loops.py`  
- Demonstrates **loops** in Python.  
- Features:  
  - Printing odd numbers from 0–100  
  - Printing even numbers from 100–0 using a while loop  
  - Custom loops based on user input (start and end values)  

### 6. `variables.py`  
- Introduces **basic Python data types and variables**:  
  - String, Integer, Float, Boolean, Set, Dictionary, List, Tuple  
- Includes interactive input/output practice with arithmetic operations and string concatenation.
